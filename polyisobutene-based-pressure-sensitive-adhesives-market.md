<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polyisobutene-Based Pressure-Sensitive Adhesives Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Waterborne</li><li>Solvent Borne</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Polyisobutene-Based Pressure-Sensitive Adhesives market is segmented into waterborne and solvent-borne types. Waterborne adhesives utilize water as a primary solvent, offering lower volatile organic compound emissions and better environmental profiles. They provide ease of application and clean-up but may require longer drying times. Solvent-borne adhesives, on the other hand, use organic solvents, leading to faster curing and strong bond performance. However, they can release more VOCs, necessitating careful handling and ventilation during use.</p></p>
